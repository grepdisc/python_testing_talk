    Title:
        Introducing TDD and GTD on a small team
        
    Summary:
        Getting things done is fun.
        Test driven development is tough. 
        Relish the productive tension between them.

Goals
======

    I want to share why:
        testing is hard              (so is exercise)
        testing is important         (so is healthy eating)
        testing is a journey         (it is its own reward)





What's Involved
=================
    Test driven development:
        1. write a failing test
        2. write code to pass that test
        3. repeat and refactor
    
    Fixtures:
        if testing were simple, we wouldn't need fixtures
        fixtures and decorators reduce boilerplate
    
    Advice:
        stick with testing
        test with a friend





Balanced testing
=================
    
    Focus on the big picture!
        integration tests 
        walking skeleton
        concentrate on interfaces

    Dig into the details!
        unit tests
        What do you care about?     Test it.





Conclusion
===========

    Hypothesis:
        sticking with testing grows better software and developers
